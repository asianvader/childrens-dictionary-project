# API Project: Children's Dictionary


##About the project
My son, Ramy, started learning to read at the age of three. Although Ramy had no issues with blending and remember vocabularly, he often didn't know the meaning of the words he was reading. I often found I was confusing him with my own explainations of what words meant! 

I looked online and Merriam-Webster have an api for their children's dictionary. I thought it would be a useful project to create.
